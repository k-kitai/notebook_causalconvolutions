Experimental implementations of neural networks using causal-convolutions.
All the neural network is built upon Gluon API of [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org).

# Implementations

01. Gated PixelCNN
02. Conditional PixelCNN
03. Dilated Convolution

# ToDo
* Caching hidden layers for fast generation
* Logistic Mixture
* VQ-VAE
* WaveNet
